## Bitcoin Ticker App
A simple crypto app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The Bitcoin Ticker app uses [Asynchronous programming in Dart](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await) to carry out time consuming tasks such as:
- Getting crypto price from an API.
- Networking to get data from the internet.

This app is able to get the current price of three cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH & LTC using JSON data from [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/).
